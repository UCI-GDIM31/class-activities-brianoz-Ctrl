One question that I have is "Is gameObject specified to a specfic object, for example if I use gamObejct for a box but I also have another object which is a treasure chest in my game would any methods be with gameobject only affect the box or would it also effect my chest as well, or does this only occur if I include the code into each objects for that?"
